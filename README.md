# BASIL

A tool developed to support Software Specification analysis and Testable Requirements definition.

It comes with a web user interface to provide a simplified view of work item relationships and with a REST web api to simplify the integration in other toolchains.

## What is it for?

With BASIL you can decompose a Software Component Specification (or source code directly) in snippets and assign to each one a set of desired work items.

BASIL will help you on identifying gaps and on tracking progress.

## Supported Work Items

- Software Testable Requirements
- Test Specifications
- Test Cases
- Justifications

## How to run it

BASIL consists of 2 sub projects, follow links for further details:

Moreover you need to init a database to be able to use BASIL:
