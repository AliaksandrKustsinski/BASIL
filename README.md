# BASIL

A tool developed to support Software Specification analysis and Testable Requirements definition.

It comes with a web user interface to provide a simplified view of work item relationships and with a REST web api to simplify the integration in other toolchains.


## What is it for?

With BASIL you can decompose a Software Component Specification (or source code directly) in snippets and assign to each one a set of desired work items.

BASIL will help you on identifying gaps and on tracking progress.


## Supported Work Items

* Software Testable Requirements
* Test Specifications
* Test Cases
* Justifications
